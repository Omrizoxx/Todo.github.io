# ðŸ“„ Spec.md â€“ Todo App

## ðŸ§© Project Description

The **Todo App** is a simple, single-page web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a clean and interactive interface to add, complete, delete, and visualize tasks in a calendar-style layout. It also supports persistent storage using the browser's localStorage, ensuring tasks remain even after the page is reloaded.
